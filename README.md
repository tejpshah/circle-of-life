## NEXT STEPS
- Implement A9 accounting for defective signal (this is tricky)
	- Potential Ideas: Update the beliefs according to Bayes Rule (given that the sensor is defective, you update all the belief rules)
	- Potential Ideas: https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/csce580/project4/ as reference Q3
	- Potential Ideas: https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/csce580/project4/ as reference Q8 (joint particle filtering)
	- Potential Ideas: https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/188224232.pdf
- Write up LaTeX information about A9. 
- Implement the bonus for when you can only move/signal. 
- Write up LaTeX information about A10. 
- Write up LaTeX Q3.5 bonus explanation. 
- Write an automated script to generate a positive and failure case video for each agent.
