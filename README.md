## Lab Report Q1.1 
We initialize the graph with 50 nodes. 
At each of the nodes, we have max degree of 3. 
So, maximum number of edges is 150*3=150 edges. 
But, with the initial circle we have 50*2=100 edges.
There are possible edges = 150 - 100 = 50 edges. 
But, each edge needs two nodes, so 50/2 = 25 max nodes
