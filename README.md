# circle-of-life
*Completed in collaboration between Tej Shah & Srinandini Marpaka*

## Overview
We develop Agents to interact in the circle-of-life game, where a Predator tries to catch the Agent (loss) before the Agent catches the Prey (win) in various environments. In the complete information and partial prey environments, the predator is optimal, always selecting actions that maximally decrease the distance to the Agent from its action space; in all other environments, the predator is distracted, choosing optimal actions with $0.6$ probability and a random neighbor with $0.4$ probability. The prey always selects any one of its neighbors or its current node randomly. We develop $A1, A2, \ldots, A10$ in various environments: complete, partial prey, partial predator, complete partial, and complete partial defective.
